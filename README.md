CAF (Code Assignment Forum)
The CAF (Code Assignment Forum) is a centralized platform designed specifically for managing and tracking tasks, issues, and updates related to various repositories. It serves as a collaboration space for developers, contributors, and teams working on multiple codebases, allowing them to streamline communication, organize assignments, and keep track of progress.

Purpose: CAF is built to support and enhance the development process for a range of repositories. It provides a space for:

Assigning specific tasks to developers.

Keeping track of ongoing progress across various repositories.

Sharing and discussing updates, bugs, features, or improvements.

Organizing and prioritizing work across different teams or contributors.

Repositories Supported:
All repositories are listed in CAF. Files that say the repository's name, than (plans) afterward are currently supported by CAF.

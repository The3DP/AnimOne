# Future Updates 

## Displaying Options
Multiple displaying options will be provided under careful testing, ensuring no hidden errors.

## More, More, More
There is a LOT of new, exciting, and, more interactive animations than before.
These will be compared to the animations existing to prove better build, solid code, and seamless operation!

# How to run animations.
Running the code from the "Anim" files is extremely quick and easy task.
